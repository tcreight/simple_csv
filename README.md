# simple_csv
This is a basic implementation of a CSV reader.
This program takes simulated temperature and humidity data from the provided {input.csv} and outputs the on/off status of a notional unit heater and cooling unit.
The current version requires that the output file be provided as a command line arg.:
Run with cargo run > {filename}.
